# Try and Except 
# valuable tool when errors or exceptions are possible

# He tries the block of code normally but if theres an error
# like comparing an integer with a string then it jumps to the except

try:
    if "ola" > 3:
        print("Hello")
except:
    print("An error was detected in your code !\n")
